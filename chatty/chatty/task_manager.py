class TaskManager(Node):
    """
    A single node that:
     1) Subscribes to /chat/output to see the entire conversation (no truncation).
     2) On new Human commands, calls GPT to parse tasks for *only* the mentioned robots
        (others keep their existing tasks).
     3) On "Event:" lines, calls GPT again to do a full re-plan. 
        - We set all robots to 'stop what you are doing' first.
        - GPT can specify new tasks or even multi-step sequences.
     4) Publishes the final plan (robot tasks + optional sequence) as JSON to /task_manager/tasks_json
        and also as text to /chat/input so the GUI sees it.

    GPT Prompt Highlights:
     - Robots can help each other by pausing/resuming tasks.
     - GPT may provide multi-step 'Sequence:' lines. 
     - We parse and store them in self.sequence_of_tasks, then publish them in the JSON.
